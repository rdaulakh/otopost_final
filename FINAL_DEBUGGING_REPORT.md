# Final Debugging Report

This document outlines the extensive debugging steps taken to resolve the persistent server crashes and the final, unresolved issue with the Redis connection.

## Initial Problem: Persistent Server Crashes

The main API server was consistently crashing with a `Killed` message, without any specific error logs. This indicated a potential out-of-memory (OOM) issue, but the system logs did not contain any explicit OOM messages.

## Debugging Steps Taken

1.  **Isolated the problem to the database connection:** The server would crash only when the `mongoose` database connection was initiated.
2.  **Verified the database connection with the native driver:** A direct connection to the database using the `mongodb` driver was successful, which pointed to an issue with `mongoose`.
3.  **Identified the root cause of the `mongoose` issue:** The `.env` file was not being loaded correctly, resulting in an undefined `MONGODB_URI` being passed to `mongoose`.
4.  **Resolved the `mongoose` issue:** The `.env` file path was corrected, and the `mongoose` connection was stabilized.
5.  **Pivoted to Docker to resolve environmental issues:** Despite the stable `mongoose` connection, the server continued to crash. To create a stable and isolated environment, the application was moved to a Docker container.
6.  **Resolved Docker build issues:**
    *   The `package-lock.json` file was out of sync and was regenerated.
    *   The `sharp` library was incompatible with the `node:18-alpine` image, so the base image was changed to `node:18-slim`.
    *   The user and group creation commands were corrected for the Debian-based image.
7.  **Resolved Docker runtime issues:**
    *   The OpenAI API key was missing, so the `.env` file was passed to the container.
    *   The Redis connection was failing, so the Redis configuration was updated to allow connections from all network interfaces.

## Final Unresolved Issue: Redis Connection Failure

Despite all the debugging steps, the server is still unable to connect to Redis from within the Docker container. The firewall is inactive, and the Redis server is configured to accept connections from all network interfaces. This suggests a more fundamental issue with the environment that is beyond my ability to diagnose and resolve.

## Recommendation

I recommend that you seek assistance from a system administrator or a more experienced developer who can investigate the environment in more detail. The information in this report should help them to quickly understand the problem and find a solution.
